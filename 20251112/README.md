# 2025 NCHC Open Hackathon

## Teams / 參賽隊伍

| Team | Domain | How much Speedup? | Why acceleration matters? |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Usagi | Climate, HPC | 777.0&times;<br>Before:&nbsp;112&times;&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;cores<br>After:&nbsp;8&times;&nbsp;H100 | Reduces months of computation to just days. Saves energy equivalent to the absorption of 80, 000 trees over a decade. Faster climate prediction. Marks a major milestone in climate science and high performance computing. |
| Parallel | Computer Vision | 184.2&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;128&times;&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;cores<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;A100 | This optimization makes the application practical. By reducing the latency to ~1.17 seconds, the tool becomes responsive and viable for deployment, enabling its integration into high-performance service workflows. |
| Qa-MolGen | Material Science, Quantum ML | 5417.9&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;64&times;&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;cores<br>After:&nbsp;2&times;&nbsp;A100 | It enables the massive-scale sampling needed to rapidly test the validity and uniqueness of new molecular structures, making the exploration of the vast chemical space feasible. |
| NYCU\_Bocchi the CUDA! | LLM | 4.6&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;V100<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;H100 | Inference speedup become one of bottleneck while training RL. Speedup enable fine-tune models more efficiently with techniques like FP8 quantization, CUDA Graphs, and multi-GPU parallelism. |
| PTSG Taiwan | Plasma | 15.1&times;<br>Before:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;V100<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;RTX4080 | The PIC/MCC simulations are a very important tool to explore processes in low-temperature plasma discharges for Today's semiconductor processing and Future. |
| AI-Taiwan VVM | Weather | 12.8&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;3&times;&nbsp;P100<br>After:&nbsp;3&times;&nbsp;A100 | This huge speedup makes it practical to use our 1-TB Taiwan's complex terrain dataset, enabling us to train a more accurate, robust, and realistic weather model for Taiwan. |
| NDVIgnition | Computer Vision, Agriculture | 5.3&times;<br>Before:&nbsp;128&times;&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;cores<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;A100 | Enables faster UAV mapping for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring, reducing hours of processing tominutes. |
| Paw Patrol | Computer Vision, Sports Science | 8.5&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;RTX2060<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;A100 | Current reconstruction pipelines are computationally expensive and too slow for real-time or large-scale applications, speedup make it pratical for real-time interaction. |
| CYCU Power Lab | Weather, Quantum ML | 109.2&times;&nbsp;(end to end)<br>Before:&nbsp;16&times;&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;cores<br>After:&nbsp;1&times;&nbsp;H100 | Enables hourly refresh forecasts with higher confidence for curtailment, crew scheduling, and trading&mdash;while cutting compute time/cost and accelerating experimentation. |
